# My Solutions to the Deep Learning Curriculum (In Progress)

I've forked Jacob's Deep Learning Curriculum. I'm working on it here, and I will be updating this repository as I go. 

I will probably not include my solutions to the written questions. This is because I doubt anybody would read them.

So far, I've written a transformer. It's available as "trans.py" in Chapter 1.
